## Hi there 👋

I’m a Principal Software Engineer and Tech Lead with over 15 years of experience in the IT and software industry.

I’m passionate about fostering a culture of open communication, continuous learning, and shared growth. As a tech lead, I believe that when individuals, teams, and the company grow together, true and lasting success emerges.

During my time at Shopware, I’ve contributed to its remarkable growth — helping the company expand from around 40 to over 400 employees. I’ve played an active role in several organizational and operational transformations that have evolved Shopware into a mature, professional software company.

I believe in user-centric, autonomous teams that go beyond writing code — teams that embrace the complexity of the customer’s problem domain. I advocate for continuous delivery and code ownership, not as policy, but as part of a seamless continuum of care:  

“You build it, you run it.”
